For natural historical climate trends, seeClimate variability and change.\"Global warming\" redirects here. For other uses, seeClimate change (disambiguation)andGlobal warming (disambiguation).Changes insurface air temperatureover the past 50 years.[1]TheArctichas warmed the most, and temperatures on land have generally increased more thansea surface temperatures.Earth\\'s average surface air temperature has increased almost 1.5°C (about2.5\\xa0°F) since theIndustrial Revolution. Natural forces cause some variability, but the 20-year average shows the progressive influence of human activity.[2]Present-dayclimate changeincludes bothglobal warming—the ongoing increase inglobal average temperature—and its wider effects onEarth\\'s climate.Climate change in a broader sensealso includes previous long-term changes to Earth\\'s climate. The current rise in global temperatures isdriven by human activities, especiallyfossil fuelburning since theIndustrial Revolution.[3][4]Fossil fuel use,deforestation, and someagriculturalandindustrialpractices releasegreenhouse gases.[5]These gasesabsorb some of the heatthat the Earthradiatesafter it warms fromsunlight, warming the lower atmosphere.Carbon dioxide, the primary gas driving global warming,has increased in concentration by about 50%since the pre-industrial era to levels not seen for millions of years.[6]Climate change has an increasingly largeimpact on the environment.Deserts are expanding, whileheat wavesandwildfiresare becoming more common.[7]Amplified warming in the Arctichas contributed to thawingpermafrost,retreat of glaciersandsea ice decline.[8]Higher temperatures are also causingmore intense storms, droughts, and otherweather extremes.[9]Rapid environmental change inmountains,coral reefs, andthe Arcticis forcing many species to relocate orbecome extinct.[10]Even if efforts to minimize future warming are successful, some effects will continue for centuries. These includeocean heating,ocean acidificationandsea level rise.[11]Climate changethreatens peoplewith increasedflooding, extreme heat, increasedfoodandwaterscarcity, more disease, andeconomic loss.Human migrationand conflict can also be a result.[12]TheWorld Health Organizationcalls climate change one of the biggest threats toglobal healthin the 21st century.[13]Societies and ecosystems will experience more severe risks withoutaction to limit warming.[14]Adapting to climate changethrough efforts likeflood controlmeasures ordrought-resistant cropspartially reduces climate change risks, although some limits toadaptationhave already been reached.[15]Poorer communities are responsible fora small share of global emissions, yet have the least ability to adapt and are mostvulnerable to climate change.[16][17]Examples of someeffects of climate change:Wildfireintensified by heat and drought,bleaching of coralsoccurring more often due tomarine heatwaves, and worseningdroughtscompromising water supplies.Many climate change impacts have been observed in the first decades of the 21st century, with 2024 the warmest on record at +1.60\\xa0°C (2.88\\xa0°F) since regular tracking began in 1850.[19][20]Additional warming will increase these impacts and can triggertipping points, such as melting all of theGreenland ice sheet.[21]Under the 2015Paris Agreement, nations collectively agreed to keep warming \"well under 2\\xa0°C\". However, with pledges made under the Agreement, global warming would still reach about 2.8\\xa0°C (5.0\\xa0°F) by the end of the century.[22]Limiting warming to 1.5\\xa0°C would require halving emissions by 2030 and achievingnet-zeroemissions by 2050.[23][24]Fossil fuel use can be phased outbyconserving energyand switching to energy sources that do not produce significant carbon pollution. These energy sources includewind,solar,hydro, andnuclear power.[25]Cleanly generated electricity can replace fossil fuels forpowering transportation,heating buildings, and running industrial processes.[26]Carbon can also beremoved from the atmosphere, for instance byincreasing forest coverand farming with methods thatcapture carbon in soil.[27]TerminologyBefore the 1980s it was unclear whether the warming effect ofincreased greenhouse gaseswas stronger than thecooling effect of airborne particulatesinair pollution. Scientists used the terminadvertent climate modificationto refer to human impacts on the climate at this time.[28]In the 1980s, the termsglobal warmingandclimate changebecame more common, often being used interchangeably.[29][30][31]Scientifically,global warmingrefers only to increased surface warming, whileclimate changedescribes both global warming and its effects on Earth\\'sclimate system, such as precipitation changes.[28]Climate changecan also be used more broadly to includechanges to the climatethat have happened throughout Earth\\'s history.[32]Global warming—used as early as 1975[33]—became the more popular term afterNASAclimate scientistJames Hansenused it in his 1988 testimony in theU.S. Senate.[34]Since the 2000s,climate changehas increased usage.[35]Various scientists, politicians and media may use the termsclimate crisisorclimate emergencyto talk about climate change, and may use the termglobal heatinginstead ofglobal warming.[36][37]Global temperature riseFurther information:Global surface temperatureTemperatures prior to present-day global warmingMain articles:Climate variability and change;Temperature record of the last 2,000 years; andPaleoclimatologyGlobal surface temperaturereconstruction over the last 2000 years using proxy data from tree rings, corals, and ice cores in blue.[38]Directly observed data is in red.[39]Over the last few million years the climate cycled throughice ages. One of the hotter periods was theLast Interglacial, around 125,000 years ago, where temperatures were between 0.5\\xa0°C and 1.5\\xa0°C warmer than before the start of global warming.[40]This period saw sea levels 5 to 10 metres higher than today. The mostrecent glacial maximum20,000 years ago was some 5–7\\xa0°C colder. This period has sea levels that were over 125 metres (410\\xa0ft) lower than today.[41]Temperatures stabilized in the current interglacial period beginning11,700 years ago.[42]This period also saw the start of agriculture.[43]Historical patterns of warming and cooling, like theMedieval Warm Periodand theLittle Ice Age, did not occur at the same time across different regions. Temperatures may have reached as high as those of the late 20th century in a limited set of regions.[44][45]Climate information for that period comes fromclimate proxies, such as trees andice cores.[46][47]Warming since the Industrial RevolutionIn recent decades, new high temperature records have substantially outpaced new low temperature records on a growing portion of Earth\\'s surface.[48]There has been an increase inocean heat contentduring recent decades as the oceans absorb over 90% of theheat from global warming.[49]Around 1850thermometerrecords began to provide global coverage.[50]Between the 18th century and 1970 there was little net warming, as the warming impact of greenhouse gas emissions was offset by cooling fromsulfur dioxideemissions. Sulfur dioxide causesacid rain, but it also producessulfateaerosols in the atmosphere, which reflect sunlight and causeglobal dimming. After 1970, the increasing accumulation of greenhouse gases and controls on sulfur pollution led to a marked increase in temperature.[51][52][53]NASA animation portraying global surface temperature changes from 1880 to 2023. The colour blue denotes cooler temperatures and red denotes warmer temperatures.Ongoing changes in climate have had no precedent for several thousand years.[54]Multiple independent datasets all show worldwide increases in surface temperature,[55]at a rate of around 0.2\\xa0°C per decade.[56]The 2014–2023 decade warmed to an average 1.19\\xa0°C [1.06–1.30\\xa0°C] compared to the pre-industrial baseline (1850–1900).[57]Not every single year was warmer than the last: internalclimate variabilityprocesses can make any year 0.2\\xa0°C warmer or colder than the average.[58]From 1998 to 2013, negative phases of two such processes,Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO)[59]andAtlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO)[60]caused a short slower period of warming called the \"global warming hiatus\".[61]After the \"hiatus\", the opposite occurred, with years like 2023 exhibiting temperatures well above even the recent average.[62]This is why the temperature change is defined in terms of a 20-year average, which reduces the noise of hot and cold years and decadal climate patterns, and detects the long-term signal.[63]:\\u200a5[64]A wide range of other observations reinforce the evidence of warming.[65][66]The upper atmosphere is cooling, becausegreenhouse gasesare trapping heat near the Earth\\'s surface, and so less heat is radiating into space.[67]Warming reduces average snow cover andforces the retreat of glaciers. At the same time, warming also causesgreater evaporation from the oceans, leading to moreatmospheric humidity, more and heavierprecipitation.[68][69]Plants arefloweringearlier in spring, and thousands of animal species have been permanently moving to cooler areas.[70]Differences by regionDifferent regions of the worldwarm at different rates. The pattern is independent of where greenhouse gases are emitted, because the gases persist long enough to diffuse across the planet. Since the pre-industrial period, the average surface temperature over land regions has increased almost twice as fast as the global average surface temperature.[71]This is because oceans lose more heat byevaporationandoceans can store a lot of heat.[72]The thermal energy in the global climate system has grown with only brief pauses since at least 1970, and over 90% of this extra energy has beenstored in the ocean.[73][74]The rest has heated theatmosphere, melted ice, and warmed the continents.[75]TheNorthern Hemisphereand theNorth Polehave warmed much faster than theSouth PoleandSouthern Hemisphere. The Northern Hemisphere not only has much more land, but also more seasonal snow cover andsea ice. As these surfaces flip from reflecting a lot of light to being dark after the ice has melted, they startabsorbing more heat.[76]Localblack carbondeposits on snow and ice also contribute to Arctic warming.[77]Arctic surface temperatures are increasingbetween three and four times fasterthan in the rest of the world.[78][79][80]Melting ofice sheetsnear the poles weakens both theAtlanticand theAntarcticlimb ofthermohaline circulation, which further changes the distribution of heat andprecipitationaround the globe.[81][82][83][84]Future global temperaturesCMIP6multi-model projections ofglobal surface temperaturechanges for the year 2090 relative to the 1850–1900 average. The current trajectory for warming by the end of the century is roughly halfway between these two extremes.[22][85][86]TheWorld Meteorological Organizationestimates there is an 80% chance that global temperatures will exceed 1.5\\xa0°C warming for at least one year between 2024 and 2028. The chance of the 5-year average being above 1.5\\xa0°C is almost half.[87]The IPCC expects the 20-year average global temperature to exceed +1.5\\xa0°C in the early 2030s.[88]TheIPCC Sixth Assessment Report(2021) included projections that by 2100 global warming is very likely to reach 1.0–1.8\\xa0°C under ascenario with very low emissions of greenhouse gases, 2.1–3.5\\xa0°C under anintermediate emissions scenario,\\nor 3.3–5.7\\xa0°C undera very high emissions scenario.[89]The warming will continue past 2100 in the intermediate and high emission scenarios,[90][91]with future projections of global surface temperatures by year 2300 being similar to millions of years ago.[92]The remainingcarbon budgetfor staying beneath certain temperature increases is determined by modelling the carbon cycle andclimate sensitivityto greenhouse gases.[93]According toUNEP, global warming can be kept below 1.5\\xa0°C with a 50% chance if emissions after 2023 do not exceed 200 gigatonnes of CO2. This corresponds to around 4 years of current emissions. To stay under 2.0\\xa0°C, the carbon budget is 900 gigatonnes of CO2, or 16 years of current emissions.[94]Causes of recent global temperature riseMain article:Causes of climate changePhysical driversof global warming that has happened so far. Futureglobal warming potentialfor long lived drivers like carbon dioxide emissions is not represented. Whiskers on each bar show the possibleerror range.The climate system experiences various cycles on its own which can last for years, decades or even centuries. For example,El Niñoevents cause short-term spikes in surface temperature whileLa Niñaevents cause short term cooling.[95]Their relative frequency can affect global temperature trends on a decadal timescale.[96]Other changes are caused by animbalance of energyfromexternal forcings.[97]Examples of these include changes in the concentrations ofgreenhouse gases,solar luminosity,volcaniceruptions, andvariations in the Earth\\'s orbitaround the Sun.[98]To determine the human contribution to climate change, unique \"fingerprints\" for all potential causes are developed and compared with both observed patterns and known internalclimate variability.[99]For example, solar forcing—whose fingerprint involves warming the entire atmosphere—is ruled out because only the lower atmosphere has warmed.[100]Atmospheric aerosols produce a smaller, cooling effect. Other drivers, such as changes inalbedo, are less impactful.[101]Greenhouse gasesMain articles:Greenhouse gas,Greenhouse gas emissions,Greenhouse effect, andCarbon dioxide in Earth\\'s atmosphereCO2concentrations over the last 800,000 years as measured from ice cores (blue/green) and directly (black)Greenhouse gases are transparent tosunlight, and thus allow it to pass through the atmosphere to heat the Earth\\'s surface. The Earthradiates it as heat, and greenhouse gases absorb a portion of it. This absorption slows the rate at which heat escapes into space, trapping heat near the Earth\\'s surface and warming it over time.[102]Whilewater vapour(≈50%) and clouds (≈25%) are the biggest contributors to the greenhouse effect, they primarily change as a function of temperature and are therefore mostly considered to befeedbacksthat changeclimate sensitivity. On the other hand, concentrations of gases such as CO2(≈20%),tropospheric ozone,[103]CFCsandnitrous oxideare added or removed independently from temperature, and are therefore considered to beexternal forcingsthat change global temperatures.[104]Before theIndustrial Revolution, naturally-occurring amounts of greenhouse gases caused the air near the surface to be about 33\\xa0°C warmer than it would have been in their absence.[105][106]Human activity since the Industrial Revolution, mainly extracting and burning fossil fuels (coal,oil, andnatural gas),[107]has increased the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. In 2022, theconcentrations of CO2and methane had increased by about 50% and 164%, respectively, since 1750.[108]These CO2levels are higher than they have been at any time during the last 14 million years.[109]Concentrations of methaneare far higher than they were over the last 800,000 years.[110]TheGlobal Carbon Projectshows how additions to CO2since 1880 have been caused by different sources ramping up one after another.Global human-caused greenhouse gas emissions in 2019 wereequivalent to59\\xa0billion tonnes of CO2. Of these emissions, 75% was CO2, 18% wasmethane, 4% was nitrous oxide, and 2% wasfluorinated gases.[111]CO2emissions primarily come from burning fossil fuels to provide energy fortransport, manufacturing,heating, and electricity.[5]Additional CO2emissions come fromdeforestationandindustrial processes, which include the CO2released by the chemical reactions formaking cement,steel,aluminum, andfertilizer.[112][113][114][115]Methane emissionscome from livestock, manure,rice cultivation, landfills, wastewater, andcoal mining, as well asoil and gas extraction.[116][117]Nitrous oxide emissions largely come from the microbial decomposition offertilizer.[118][119]While methane only lasts in the atmosphere for an average of 12 years,[120]CO2lasts much longer. The Earth\\'s surface absorbs CO2as part of thecarbon cycle. While plants on land and in the ocean absorb most excess emissions of CO2every year, that CO2is returned to the atmosphere when biological matter is digested, burns, or decays.[121]Land-surfacecarbon sinkprocesses, such ascarbon fixationin the soil and photosynthesis, remove about 29% of annual global CO2emissions.[122]The ocean has absorbed 20 to 30% of emitted CO2over the last two decades.[123]CO2is only removed from the atmosphere for the long term when it is stored in the Earth\\'s crust, which is a process that can take millions of years to complete.[121]Land surface changesThe rate of global tree cover loss has approximately doubled since 2001, to an annual loss approaching an area the size of Italy.[124]Around 30% of Earth\\'s land area is largely unusable for humans (glaciers,deserts, etc.), 26% isforests, 10% isshrublandand 34% isagricultural land.[125]Deforestationis the mainland use changecontributor to global warming,[126]as the destroyed trees release CO2, and are not replaced by new trees, removing thatcarbon sink.[127]Between 2001 and 2018, 27% of deforestation was from permanent clearing to enableagricultural expansionfor crops and livestock. Another 24% has been lost to temporary clearing under theshifting cultivationagricultural systems. 26% was due tologgingfor wood and derived products, andwildfireshave accounted for the remaining 23%.[128]Some forests have not been fully cleared, but were already degraded by these impacts. Restoring these forests also recovers their potential as a carbon sink.[129]Local vegetation cover impacts how much of the sunlight gets reflected back into space (albedo), and how muchheat is lost by evaporation. For instance, the change from a darkforestto grassland makes the surface lighter, causing it to reflect more sunlight. Deforestation can also modify the release of chemical compounds that influence clouds, and by changing wind patterns.[130]In tropic and temperate areas the net effect is to produce significant warming, and forest restoration can make local temperatures cooler.[129]At latitudes closer to the poles, there is a cooling effect as forest is replaced by snow-covered (and more reflective) plains.[130]Globally, these increases in surface albedo have been the dominant direct influence on temperature from land use change. Thus, land use change to date is estimated to have a slight cooling effect.[131]Other factorsAerosols and cloudsAir pollution, in the form ofaerosols, affects the climateon a large scale.[132]Aerosols scatter and absorb solar radiation. From 1961 to 1990, a gradual reduction in the amount ofsunlight reaching the Earth\\'s surfacewas observed. This phenomenon is popularly known asglobal dimming,[133]and is primarily attributed tosulfateaerosols produced by the combustion of fossil fuels with heavy sulfur concentrations likecoalandbunker fuel.[53]Smaller contributions come fromblack carbon(from combustion of fossil fuels and biomass), and from dust.[134][135][136]Globally, aerosols have been declining since 1990 due to pollution controls, meaning that they no longer mask greenhouse gas warming as much.[137][53]Aerosols also have indirect effects on theEarth\\'s energy budget. Sulfate aerosols act ascloud condensation nucleiand lead to clouds that have more and smaller cloud droplets. These clouds reflect solar radiation more efficiently than clouds with fewer and larger droplets.[138]They also reduce thegrowth of raindrops, which makes clouds more reflective to incoming sunlight.[139]Indirect effects of aerosols are the largest uncertainty inradiative forcing.[140]While aerosols typically limit global warming by reflecting sunlight,black carboninsootthat falls on snow or ice can contribute to global warming. Not only does this increase the absorption of sunlight, it also increases melting and sea-level rise.[141]Limiting new black carbon deposits in the Arctic could reduce global warming by 0.2\\xa0°C by 2050.[142]The effect of decreasing sulfur content of fuel oil for ships since 2020[143]is estimated to cause an additional 0.05\\xa0°C increase in global mean temperature by 2050.[144]Solar and volcanic activityFurther information:Solar activity and climateTheFourth National Climate Assessment(\"NCA4\", USGCRP, 2017) includes charts illustrating that neither solar nor volcanic activity can explain the observed warming.[145][146]As the Sun is the Earth\\'s primary energy source, changes in incoming sunlight directly affect theclimate system.[140]Solar irradiancehas been measured directly bysatellites,[147]and indirect measurements are available from the early 1600s onwards.[140]Since 1880, there has been no upward trend in the amount of the Sun\\'s energy reaching the Earth, in contrast to the warming of the lower atmosphere (thetroposphere).[148]The upper atmosphere (thestratosphere) would also be warming if the Sun was sending more energy to Earth, but instead, it has been cooling.[100]This is consistent with greenhouse gases preventing heat from leaving the Earth\\'s atmosphere.[149]Explosive volcanic eruptionscan release gases, dust and ash that partially block sunlight and reduce temperatures, or they can send water vapour into the atmosphere, which adds to greenhouse gases and increases temperatures.[150]These impacts on temperature only last for several years, because both water vapour and volcanic material have low persistence in the atmosphere.[151]volcanic CO2emissionsare more persistent, but they are equivalent to less than 1% of current human-caused CO2emissions.[152]Volcanic activity still represents the single largest natural impact (forcing) on temperature in the industrial era. Yet, like the other natural forcings, it has had negligible impacts on global temperature trends since the Industrial Revolution.[151]Climate change feedbacksMain articles:Climate change feedbacksandClimate sensitivitySea ice reflects 50% to 70% of incoming sunlight, while the ocean, being darker, reflects only 6%. As an area of sea ice melts and exposes more ocean, more heat is absorbed by the ocean, raising temperatures that melt still more ice. This is a positive feedbackprocess.[153]The climate system\\'s response to an initial forcing is shaped by feedbacks, which either amplify or dampen the change.Self-reinforcingorpositivefeedbacks increase the response, whilebalancingornegativefeedbacks reduce it.[154]The main reinforcing feedbacks are thewater-vapour feedback, theice–albedo feedback, and the net effect of clouds.[155][156]The primary balancing mechanism isradiative cooling, as Earth\\'s surface gives off moreheatto space in response to rising temperature.[157]In addition to temperature feedbacks, there are feedbacks in the carbon cycle, such as the fertilizing effect of CO2on plant growth.[158]Feedbacks are expected to trend in a positive direction as greenhouse gas emissions continue, raising climate sensitivity.[159]These feedback processes alter the pace of global warming. For instance, warmer aircan hold more moisturein the form ofwater vapour, which is itself a potent greenhouse gas.[155]Warmer air can also make clouds higher and thinner, and therefore more insulating, increasing climate warming.[160]The reduction of snow cover and sea ice in the Arctic is another major feedback, this reduces the reflectivity of the Earth\\'s surface in the region andaccelerates Arctic warming.[161][162]This additional warming also contributes topermafrostthawing, which releases methane and CO2into the atmosphere.[163]Around half of human-caused CO2emissions have been absorbed by land plants and by the oceans.[164]This fraction is not static and if future CO2emissions decrease, the Earth will be able to absorb up to around 70%. If they increase substantially, it\\'ll still absorb more carbon than now, but the overall fraction will decrease to below 40%.[165]This is because climate change increases droughts and heat waves that eventually inhibit plant growth on land, and soils will release more carbon from dead plantswhen they are warmer.[166][167]The rate at which oceans absorb atmospheric carbon will be lowered as they become more acidic and experience changes inthermohaline circulationandphytoplanktondistribution.[168][169][82]Uncertainty over feedbacks, particularly cloud cover,[170]is the major reason why different climate models project different magnitudes of warming for a given amount of emissions.[171]ModellingFurther information:Climate modelandClimate change scenarioEnergy flows between space, the atmosphere, and Earth\\'s surface. Most sunlight passes through the atmosphere to heat the Earth\\'s surface, then greenhouse gases absorb most of the heat the Earth radiates in response. Adding to greenhouse gases increases this insulating effect, causing anenergy imbalancethat heats the planet up.Aclimate modelis a representation of the physical, chemical and biological processes that affect the climate system.[172]Models include natural processes like changes in the Earth\\'s orbit, historical changes in the Sun\\'s activity, and volcanic forcing.[173]Models are used to estimate the degree of warming future emissions will cause when accounting for thestrength of climate feedbacks.[174][175]Models also predict the circulation of the oceans, the annual cycle of the seasons, and the flows of carbon between the land surface and the atmosphere.[176]The physical realism of models is tested by examining their ability to simulate current or past climates.[177]Past models have underestimated the rate ofArctic shrinkage[178]and underestimated the rate of precipitation increase.[179]Sea level rise since 1990 was underestimated in older models, but more recent models agree well with observations.[180]The 2017 United States-publishedNational Climate Assessmentnotes that \"climate models may still be underestimating or missing relevant feedback processes\".[181]Additionally, climate models may be unable to adequately predict short-term regional climatic shifts.[182]Asubset of climate modelsadd societal factors to a physical climate model. These models simulate how population,economic growth, and energy use affect—and interact with—the physical climate. With this information, these models can produce scenarios of future greenhouse gas emissions. This is then used as input for physical climate models and carbon cycle models to predict how atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases might change.[183][184]Depending on thesocioeconomic scenarioand the mitigation scenario, models produce atmospheric CO2concentrations that range widely between 380 and 1400 ppm.[185]ImpactsMain article:Effects of climate changeThe sixth IPCC Assessment Report projects changes in average soil moisture at 2.0\\xa0°C of warming, as measured instandard deviationsfrom the 1850 to 1900 baseline.Environmental effectsFurther information:Effects of climate change on oceansandEffects of climate change on the water cycleThe environmental effects of climate change are broad and far-reaching,affecting oceans, ice, and weather. Changes may occur gradually or rapidly. Evidence for these effects comes from studying climate change in the past, from modelling, and from modern observations.[186]Since the 1950s,droughtsand heat waves have appeared simultaneously with increasing frequency.[187]Extremely wet or dry events within themonsoonperiod have increased in India and East Asia.[188]Monsoonal precipitation over the Northern Hemisphere has increased since 1980.[189]The rainfall rate and intensity ofhurricanes and typhoons is likely increasing,[190]and the geographic range likely expanding poleward in response to climate warming.[191]Frequency of tropical cyclones has not increased as a result of climate change.[192]Historical sea level reconstruction and projections up to 2100 published in 2017 by the U.S. Global Change Research Program[193]Global sea level is rising as a consequence ofthermal expansionandthe melting of glaciersandice sheets. Sea level rise has increased over time, reaching 4.8\\xa0cm per decade between 2014 and 2023.[194]Over the 21st century, the IPCC projects 32–62\\xa0cm of sea level rise under a low emission scenario, 44–76\\xa0cm under an intermediate one and 65–101\\xa0cm under a very high emission scenario.[195]Marine ice sheet instabilityprocesses in Antarctica may add substantially to these values,[196]including the possibility of a 2-meter sea level rise by 2100 under high emissions.[197]Climate change has led to decades ofshrinking and thinning of the Arctic sea ice.[198]While ice-free summers are expected to be rare at 1.5\\xa0°C degrees of warming, they are set to occur once every three to ten years at a warming level of 2\\xa0°C.[199]Higher atmospheric CO2concentrations cause more CO2to dissolve in the oceans, which ismaking them more acidic.[200]Because oxygen is less soluble in warmer water,[201]its concentrations in the oceanare decreasing, anddead zonesare expanding.[202]Tipping points and long-term impactsDifferent levels of global warming may cause different parts of Earth\\'s climate system to reach tipping points that cause transitions to different states.[203][204]Main article:Tipping points in the climate systemGreater degrees of global warming increase the risk of passing through \\'tipping points\\'—thresholds beyond which certain major impacts can no longer be avoided even if temperatures return to their previous state.[205][206]For instance, theGreenland ice sheetis already melting, but if global warming reaches levels between 1.7\\xa0°C and 2.3\\xa0°C, its melting will continue until it fully disappears. If the warming is later reduced to 1.5\\xa0°C or less, it will still lose a lot more ice than if the warming was never allowed to reach the threshold in the first place.[207]While the ice sheets would melt over millennia, other tipping points would occur faster and give societies less time to respond. The collapse of majorocean currentslike theAtlantic meridional overturning circulation(AMOC), and irreversible damage to key ecosystems like theAmazon rainforestandcoral reefscan unfold in a matter of decades.[204]The long-termeffects of climate change on oceansinclude further ice melt,ocean warming, sea level rise, ocean acidification and ocean deoxygenation.[208]The timescale of long-term impacts are centuries to millennia due to CO2\\'s long atmospheric lifetime.[209]The result is an estimated total sea level rise of 2.3 metres per degree Celsius (4.2\\xa0ft/°F) after 2000 years.[210]Oceanic CO2uptake is slow enough that ocean acidification will also continue for hundreds to thousands of years.[211]Deep oceans (below 2,000 metres (6,600\\xa0ft)) are also already committed to losing over 10% of their dissolved oxygen by the warming which occurred to date.[212]Further, theWest Antarctic ice sheetappears committed to practically irreversible melting, which would increase the sea levels by at least 3.3\\xa0m (10\\xa0ft 10\\xa0in) over approximately 2000 years.[204][213][214]Nature and wildlifeFurther information:Effects of climate change on oceansandEffects of climate change on biomesRecent warming has driven many terrestrial and freshwater species poleward and towards higheraltitudes.[215]For instance, the range of hundreds of North Americanbirdshas shifted northward at an average rate of 1.5\\xa0km/year over the past 55 years.[216]Higher atmospheric CO2levels and an extended growing season have resulted in global greening. However, heatwaves and drought have reducedecosystemproductivity in some regions. The future balance of these opposing effects is unclear.[217]A related phenomenon driven by climate change iswoody plant encroachment, affecting up to 500 million hectares globally.[218]Climate change has contributed to the expansion of drier climate zones, such as theexpansion of desertsin thesubtropics.[219]The size and speed of global warming is makingabrupt changes in ecosystemsmore likely.[220]Overall, it is expected that climate change will result in theextinctionof many species.[221]The oceans have heated more slowly than the land, but plants and animals in the ocean have migrated towards the colder poles faster than species on land.[222]Just as on land,heat waves in the oceanoccur more frequently due to climate change, harming a wide range of organisms such as corals,kelp, andseabirds.[223]Ocean acidification makes it harder formarine calcifying organismssuch asmussels,barnaclesand corals toproduce shells and skeletons; and heatwaves havebleached coral reefs.[224]Harmful algal bloomsenhanced by climate change andeutrophicationlower oxygen levels, disruptfood websand cause great loss of marine life.[225]Coastal ecosystems are under particular stress. Almost half of global wetlands have disappeared due to climate change and other human impacts.[226]Plants have come under increased stress from damage by insects.[227]Climate change impacts on the environmentEcological collapse.Coral bleachingfromthermal stresshas damaged theGreat Barrier Reefand threatenscoral reefsworldwide.[228]Extreme weather.

If warming reaches 4\\xa0°C then labour capacity in those regions could be reduced by 30 to 50%.[252]TheWorld Bankestimates that between 2016 and 2030, climate change could drive over 120 million people into extreme poverty without adaptation.[253]Inequalities based on wealth and social status have worsened due to climate change.[254]Major difficulties in mitigating, adapting to, and recovering from climate shocks are faced by marginalized people who have less control over resources.[255][250]Indigenous people, who are subsistent on their land and ecosystems, will face endangerment to their wellness and lifestyles due to climate change.[256]An expert elicitation concluded that the role of climate change inarmed conflicthas been small compared to factors such as socio-economic inequality and state capabilities.[257]While women are not inherently more at risk from climate change and shocks, limits on women\\'s resources and discriminatory gender norms constrain their adaptive capacity and resilience.[258]For example, women\\'s work burdens, including hours worked in agriculture, tend to decline less than men\\'s during climate shocks such as heat stress.[258]Climate migrationMain article:Climate migrationLow-lying islands and coastal communities are threatened by sea level rise, which makesurban floodingmore common. Sometimes, land is permanently lost to the sea.[259]This could lead tostatelessnessfor people in island nations, such as theMaldivesandTuvalu.[260]In some regions, the rise in temperature and humidity may be too severe for humans to adapt to.[261]With worst-case climate change, models project that almost one-third of humanity might live in Sahara-like uninhabitable and extremely hot climates.[262]These factors can driveclimateorenvironmental migration, within and between countries.[263]More people are expected to be displaced because of sea level rise, extreme weather and conflict from increased competition over natural resources. Climate change may also increase vulnerability, leading to \"trapped populations\" who are not able to move due to a lack of resources.[264]Climate change impacts on peopleEnvironmental migration.

Events like the2022 Southern Cone heat waveare becoming more common.[269]Reducing and recapturing emissionsFurther information:Climate change mitigationGlobal greenhouse gas emission scenarios, based on policies and pledges as of November 2021Climate change can be mitigated by reducing the rate at which greenhouse gases are emitted into the atmosphere, and by increasing the rate at which carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere.[270]To limit global warming to less than 1.5\\xa0°C global greenhouse gas emissions needs to benet-zeroby 2050, or by 2070 with a 2\\xa0°C target.[271]This requires far-reaching, systemic changes on an unprecedented scale in energy, land, cities, transport, buildings, and industry.[272]TheUnited Nations Environment Programmeestimates that countries need to triple theirpledges under the Paris Agreementwithin the next decade to limit global warming to 2\\xa0°C. An even greater level of reduction is required to meet the 1.5\\xa0°C goal.[273]With pledges made under the Paris Agreement as of 2024, there would be a 66% chance that global warming is kept under 2.8\\xa0°C by the end of the century (range: 1.9–3.7\\xa0°C, depending on exact implementation and technological progress). When only considering current policies, this raises to 3.1\\xa0°C.[274]Globally, limiting warming to 2\\xa0°C may result in higher economic benefits than economic costs.[275]Although there is no single pathway to limit global warming to 1.5 or 2\\xa0°C,[276]most scenarios and strategies see a major increase in the use of renewable energy in combination with increased energy efficiency measures to generate the needed greenhouse gas reductions.[277]To reduce pressures on ecosystems and enhance their carbon sequestration capabilities, changes would also be necessary in agriculture and forestry,[278]such as preventingdeforestationand restoring natural ecosystems byreforestation.[279]Other approaches to mitigating climate change have a higher level of risk. Scenarios that limit global warming to 1.5\\xa0°C typically project the large-scale use ofcarbon dioxide removal methodsover the 21st century.[280]There are concerns, though, about over-reliance on these technologies, and environmental impacts.[281]Solar radiation modification(SRM) is under discussion as a possible supplement to reductions in emissions. However, SRM raises significant ethical andglobal governanceconcerns, and its risks are not well understood.[282]Clean energyMain articles:Sustainable energyandSustainable transportCoal, oil, and natural gas remain the primaryglobal energysources even asrenewableshave begun rapidly increasing.[283]Wind and solar power, GermanyRenewable energy is key to limiting climate change.[284]For decades, fossil fuels have accounted for roughly 80% of the world\\'s energy use.[285]The remaining share has been split between nuclear power and renewables (includinghydropower,bioenergy, wind and solar power andgeothermal energy).[286]Fossil fuel use is expected to peak in absolute terms prior to 2030 and then to decline, with coal use experiencing the sharpest reductions.[287]Renewables represented 86% of all new electricity generation installed in 2023.[288]Other forms of clean energy, such as nuclear and hydropower, currently have a larger share of the energy supply. However, their future growth forecasts appear limited in comparison.[289]Whilesolar panelsand onshore wind are now among the cheapest forms of adding new power generation capacity in many locations,[290]green energy policies are needed to achieve a rapid transition from fossil fuels to renewables.[291]To achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, renewable energy would become the dominant form of electricity generation, rising to 85% or more by 2050 in some scenarios. Investment in coal would be eliminated and coal use nearly phased out by 2050.[292][293]Electricity generated from renewable sources would also need to become the main energy source for heating and transport.[294]Transport can switch away frominternal combustion enginevehicles and towardselectric vehicles, public transit, andactive transport(cycling and walking).[295][296]For shipping and flying, low-carbon fuels would reduce emissions.[295]Heating could be increasingly decarbonized with technologies likeheat pumps.[297]There are obstacles to the continued rapid growth of clean energy, including renewables.[298]Wind and solar produce energyintermittently and with seasonal variability. Traditionally,hydro dams with reservoirsand fossil fuel power plants have been used when variable energy production is low. Going forward,battery storagecan be expanded,energy demand and supplycan be matched, and long-distancetransmissioncan smooth variability of renewable outputs.[284]Bioenergy is often not carbon-neutral and may have negative consequences for food security.[299]The growth of nuclear power is constrained by controversy aroundradioactive waste,nuclear weapon proliferation, andaccidents.[300][301]Hydropower growth is limited by the fact that the best sites have been developed, and new projects are confronting increased social and environmental concerns.[302]Low-carbon energyimproves human health by minimizing climate change as well as reducing air pollution deaths,[303]which were estimated at 7 million annually in 2016.[304]Meeting the Paris Agreement goals that limit warming to a 2\\xa0°C increase could save about a million of those lives per year by 2050, whereas limiting global warming to 1.5\\xa0°C could save millions and simultaneously increaseenergy securityand reduce poverty.[305]Improving air quality also has economic benefits which may be larger than mitigation costs.[306]Energy conservationMain articles:Efficient energy useandEnergy conservationReducing energy demand is another major aspect of reducing emissions.[307]If less energy is needed, there is more flexibility for clean energy development. It also makes it easier to manage the electricity grid, and minimizescarbon-intensiveinfrastructure development.[308]Major increases in energy efficiency investment will be required to achieve climate goals, comparable to the level of investment in renewable energy.[309]SeveralCOVID-19related changes in energy use patterns, energy efficiency investments, and funding have made forecasts for this decade more difficult and uncertain.[310]Strategies to reduce energy demand vary by sector. In the transport sector, passengers and freight can switch to more efficient travel modes, such as buses and trains, or use electric vehicles.[311]Industrial strategies to reduce energy demand include improving heating systems and motors, designing less energy-intensive products, and increasing product lifetimes.[312]In the building sector the focus is on better design of new buildings, and higher levels of energy efficiency in retrofitting.[313]The use of technologies like heat pumps can also increase building energy efficiency.[314]Agriculture and industrySee also:Sustainable agricultureandGreen industrial policyTaking into account direct and indirect emissions, industry is the sector with the highest share of global emissions. Data as of 2019 from the IPCC.Agriculture and forestry face a triple challenge of limiting greenhouse gas emissions, preventing the further conversion of forests to agricultural land, and meeting increases in world food demand.[315]A set of actions could reduce agriculture and forestry-based emissions by two-thirds from 2010 levels. These include reducing growth in demand for food and other agricultural products, increasing land productivity, protecting and restoring forests, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural production.[316]On the demand side, a key component of reducing emissions is shifting people towardsplant-based diets.[317]Eliminating the production of livestock formeat and dairywould eliminate about 3/4ths of all emissions from agriculture and other land use.[318]Livestock also occupy 37% of ice-free land area on Earth and consume feed from the 12% of land area used for crops, driving deforestation and land degradation.[319]Steel and cement production are responsible for about 13% of industrial CO2emissions. In these industries, carbon-intensive materials such as coke and lime play an integral role in the production, so that reducing CO2emissions requires research into alternative chemistries.[320]Where energy production or CO2-intensiveheavy industriescontinue to produce waste CO2, technology can sometimes be used to capture and store most of the gas instead of releasing it to the atmosphere.[321]This technology,carbon capture and storage(CCS), could have a critical but limited role in reducing emissions.[321]It is relatively expensive[322]and has been deployed only to an extent that removes around 0.1% of annual greenhouse gas emissions.[321]Carbon dioxide removalMain articles:Carbon dioxide removalandCarbon sequestrationMost CO2emissions have been absorbed bycarbon sinks, including plant growth, soil uptake, and ocean uptake (2020 Global Carbon Budget).Natural carbon sinks can be enhanced to sequester significantly larger amounts of CO2beyond naturally occurring levels.[323]Reforestation andafforestation(planting forests where there were none before) are among the most mature sequestration techniques, although the latter raises food security concerns.[324]Farmers can promote sequestration ofcarbon in soilsthrough practices such as use of wintercover crops, reducing the intensity and frequency oftillage, and using compost and manure as soil amendments.[325]Forest and landscape restoration yields many benefits for the climate, including greenhouse gas emissions sequestration and reduction.[129]Restoration/recreation of coastal wetlands,prairie plotsandseagrass meadowsincreases the uptake of carbon into organic matter.[326][327]When carbon is sequestered in soils and in organic matter such as trees, there is a risk of the carbon being re-released into the atmosphere later through changes in land use, fire, or other changes in ecosystems.[328]The use of bioenergy in conjunction with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) can result in net negative emissions as CO2is drawn from the atmosphere.[329]It remains highly uncertain whether carbon dioxide removal techniques will be able to play a large role in limiting warming to 1.5\\xa0°C. Policy decisions that rely on carbon dioxide removal increase the risk of global warming rising beyond international goals.[330]AdaptationMain article:Climate change adaptationAdaptation is \"the process of adjustment to current or expected changes in climate and its effects\".[331]:\\u200a5Without additional mitigation, adaptation cannot avert the risk of \"severe, widespread and irreversible\" impacts.[332]More severe climate change requires more transformative adaptation, which can be prohibitively expensive.[333]Thecapacity and potential for humans to adaptis unevenly distributed across different regions and populations, and developing countries generally have less.[334]The first two decades of the 21st century saw an increase in adaptive capacity in most low- and middle-income countries with improved access to basicsanitationand electricity, but progress is slow. Many countries have implemented adaptation policies. However, there is a considerable gap between necessary and available finance.[335]Adaptation to sea level rise consists of avoiding at-risk areas, learning to live with increased flooding, and buildingflood controls. If that fails,managed retreatmay be needed.[336]There are economic barriers for tackling dangerous heat impact. Avoiding strenuous work or havingair conditioningis not possible for everybody.[337]In agriculture, adaptation options include a switch to more sustainable diets, diversification, erosion control, and genetic improvements for increased tolerance to a changing climate.[338]Insurance allows for risk-sharing, but is often difficult to get for people on lower incomes.[339]Education, migration andearly warning systemscan reduce climate vulnerability.[340]Planting mangroves or encouraging other coastal vegetation can buffer storms.[341][342]Ecosystems adapt to climate change, a process that can be supported by human intervention. By increasing connectivity between ecosystems, species can migrate to more favourable climate conditions. Species can also beintroduced to areas acquiring a favourable climate. Protection and restoration of natural and semi-natural areas helps build resilience, making it easier for ecosystems to adapt. Many of the actions that promote adaptation in ecosystems, also help humans adapt viaecosystem-based adaptation. For instance, restoration ofnatural fire regimesmakes catastrophic fires less likely, and reduces human exposure. Giving rivers more space allows for more water storage in the natural system, reducing flood risk. Restored forest acts as a carbon sink, but planting trees in unsuitable regions can exacerbate climate impacts.[343]There aresynergiesbut also trade-offs between adaptation and mitigation.[344]An example for synergy is increased food productivity, which has large benefits for both adaptation and mitigation.[345]An example of a trade-off is that increased use of air conditioning allows people to better cope with heat, but increases energy demand. Another trade-off example is that more compacturban developmentmay reduce emissions from transport and construction, but may also increase theurban heat islandeffect, exposing people to heat-related health risks.[346]Examples of adaptation methodsMangroveplanting and otherhabitat conservationcan reducecoastal flooding.Seawallsto protect againststorm surgeworsened bysea level riseGreen roofsto provide cooling in citiesSelective breedingfordrought-resistant cropsPolicies and politicsSee also:Politics of climate changeandClimate change mitigation §\\xa0PoliciesTheClimate Change Performance Indexranks countries by greenhouse gas emissions (40% of score), renewable energy (20%), energy use (20%), and climate policy (20%).HighMediumLowVery lowCountries that are mostvulnerable to climate changehave typically been responsible for a small share of global emissions. This raises questions about justice and fairness.[347]Limiting global warming makes it much easier to achieve the UN\\'sSustainable Development Goals, such as eradicating poverty and reducing inequalities. The connection is recognized inSustainable Development Goal 13which is to \"take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts\".[348]The goals on food, clean water and ecosystem protection have synergies with climate mitigation.[349]Thegeopoliticsof climate change is complex. It has often been framed as afree-rider problem, in which all countries benefit from mitigation done by other countries, but individual countries would lose from switching to alow-carbon economythemselves. Sometimes mitigation also has localized benefits though. For instance, the benefits of acoal phase-outto public health and local environments exceed the costs in almost all regions.[350]Furthermore, net importers of fossil fuels win economically from switching to clean energy, causing net exporters to facestranded assets: fossil fuels they cannot sell.[351]Policy optionsFurther information:Climate policyA wide range ofpolicies,regulations, and laws are being used to reduce emissions. As of 2019,carbon pricingcovers about 20% of global greenhouse gas emissions.[352]Carbon can be priced withcarbon taxesandemissions trading systems.[353]Direct globalfossil fuel subsidiesreached $319\\xa0billion in 2017, and $5.2\\xa0trillion when indirect costs such as air pollution are priced in.[354]Ending these can cause a 28% reduction in global carbon emissions and a 46% reduction in air pollution deaths.[355]Money saved on fossil subsidies could be used to support thetransition to clean energyinstead.[356]More direct methods to reduce greenhouse gases include vehicle efficiency standards, renewable fuel standards, and air pollution regulations on heavy industry.[357]Several countriesrequire utilities to increase the share of renewables in power production.[358]Climate justicePolicy designed through the lens ofclimate justicetries to addresshuman rightsissues and social inequality. According to proponents of climate justice, the costs of climate adaptation should be paid by those most responsible for climate change, while the beneficiaries of payments should be those suffering impacts. One way this can be addressed in practice is to have wealthy nations pay poorer countries to adapt.[359]Oxfam found that in 2023 the wealthiest 10% of people were responsible for 50% of global emissions, while the bottom 50% were responsible for just 8%.[360]Production of emissions is another way to look at responsibility: under that approach, the top 21 fossil fuel companies would owe cumulativeclimate reparationsof $5.4\\xa0trillion over the period 2025–2050.[361]To achieve ajust transition, people working in the fossil fuel sector would also need other jobs, and their communities would need investments.[362]International climate agreementsFurther information:United Nations Framework Convention on Climate ChangeSince 2000, rising CO2emissions in China and the rest of world have surpassed the output of the United States and Europe.[363]Per person, the United States generates CO2at a far faster rate than other primary regions.[363]Nearly all countries in the world are parties to the 1994United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change(UNFCCC).[364]The goal of the UNFCCC is to prevent dangerous human interference with the climate system.[365]As stated in the convention, this requires that greenhouse gas concentrations are stabilized in the atmosphere at a level where ecosystems can adapt naturally to climate change, food production is not threatened, andeconomic developmentcan be sustained.[366]The UNFCCC does not itself restrict emissions but rather provides a framework for protocols that do. Global emissions have risen since the UNFCCC was signed.[367]Its yearly conferencesare the stage of global negotiations.[368]The 1997Kyoto Protocolextended the UNFCCC and included legally binding commitments for most developed countries to limit their emissions.[369]During the negotiations, theG77(representingdeveloping countries) pushed for a mandate requiringdeveloped countriesto \"[take] the lead\" in reducing their emissions,[370]since developed countries contributed most to theaccumulation of greenhouse gasesin the atmosphere. Per-capita emissions were also still relatively low in developing countries and developing countries would need to emit more to meet their development needs.[371]The 2009Copenhagen Accordhas been widely portrayed as disappointing because of its low goals, and was rejected by poorer nations including the G77.[372]Associated parties aimed to limit the global temperature rise to below 2\\xa0°C.[373]The Accord set the goal of sending $100\\xa0billion per year to developing countries for mitigation and adaptation by 2020, and proposed the founding of theGreen Climate Fund.[374]As of 2020[update], only 83.3\\xa0billion were delivered. Only in 2023 the target is expected to be achieved.[375]In 2015 all UN countries negotiated theParis Agreement, which aims to keep global warming well below 2.0\\xa0°C and contains an aspirational goal of keeping warming under1.5\\xa0°C.[376]The agreement replaced the Kyoto Protocol. Unlike Kyoto, no binding emission targets were set in the Paris Agreement. Instead, a set of procedures was made binding. Countries have to regularly set ever more ambitious goals and reevaluate these goals every five years.[377]The Paris Agreement restated that developing countries must be financially supported.[378]As of October 2021[update], 194 states and theEuropean Unionhave signed the treaty and 191 states and the EU haveratifiedor acceded to the agreement.[379]The 1987Montreal Protocol, an international agreement to phase out production of ozone-depleting gases, has had benefits for climate change mitigation.[380]Several ozone-depleting gases likechlorofluorocarbonsare powerful greenhouse gases, so banning their production and usage may have avoided a temperature rise of 0.5\\xa0°C–1.0\\xa0°C,[381]as well as additional warming by preventing damage to vegetation fromultravioletradiation.[382]It is estimated that the agreement has been more effective at curbing greenhouse gas emissions than the Kyoto Protocol specifically designed to do so.[383]The most recent amendment to the Montreal Protocol, the 2016Kigali Amendment, committed to reducing the emissions ofhydrofluorocarbons, which served as a replacement for banned ozone-depleting gases and are also potent greenhouse gases.[384]Should countries comply with the amendment, a warming of 0.3\\xa0°C–0.5\\xa0°C is estimated to be avoided.[385]National responsesAnnualCO2emissions by region. This measures fossil fuel and industry emissions.Land use changeis not included.[386]In 2019, theUnited Kingdom parliamentbecame the first national government to declare a climate emergency.[387]Other countries andjurisdictionsfollowed suit.[388]That same year, theEuropean Parliamentdeclared a \"climate and environmental emergency\".[389]TheEuropean Commissionpresented itsEuropean Green Dealwith the goal of making the EU carbon-neutral by 2050.[390]In 2021, the European Commission released its \"Fit for 55\" legislation package, which contains guidelines for thecar industry; all new cars on the European market must bezero-emission vehiclesfrom 2035.[391]Major countries in Asia have made similar pledges: South Korea and Japan have committed to become carbon-neutral by 2050, and China by 2060.[392]While India has strong incentives for renewables, it also plans a significant expansion of coal in the country.[393]Vietnam is among very few coal-dependent, fast-developing countries that pledged to phase out unabated coal power by the 2040s or as soon as possible thereafter.[394]As of 2021, based on information from 48national climate plans, which represent 40% of the parties to the Paris Agreement, estimated total greenhouse gas emissions will be 0.5% lower compared to 2010 levels, below the 45% or 25% reduction goals to limit global warming to 1.5\\xa0°C or 2\\xa0°C, respectively.[395]SocietyDenial and misinformationFurther information:Climate change denialandFossil fuels lobbyData has beencherry pickedfrom short periods to falsely assert that global temperatures are not rising. Blue trendlines show short periods that mask longer-term warming trends (red trendlines). Blue rectangle with blue dots shows the so-calledglobal warming hiatus.[396]Public debate about climate change has been strongly affected by climate change denial andmisinformation, which originated in the United States and has since spread to other countries, particularly Canada and Australia. Climate change denial has originated from fossil fuel companies, industry groups,conservativethink tanks, andcontrarianscientists.[397]Like the tobacco industry, the main strategy of these groups has been to manufacture doubt about climate-change related scientific data and results.[398]People who hold unwarranted doubt about climate change are called climate change \"skeptics\", although \"contrarians\" or \"deniers\" are more appropriate terms.[399]There are different variants of climate denial: some deny that warming takes place at all, some acknowledge warming but attribute it to natural influences, and some minimize the negative impacts of climate change.[400]Manufacturing uncertainty about the science later developed into amanufactured controversy: creating the belief that there is significant uncertainty about climate change within the scientific community to delay policy changes.[401]Strategies to promote these ideas include criticism of scientific institutions,[402]and questioning the motives of individual scientists.[400]Anecho chamberof climate-denyingblogsand media has further fomented misunderstanding of climate change.[403]Public awareness and opinionFurther information:Climate communication,Media coverage of climate change, andPublic opinion on climate changeThe public substantially underestimates the degree of scientific consensus that humans are causing climate change.[404]Studies from 2019 to 2021[405][4][406]found scientific consensus to range from 98.7 to 100%.Climate change came to international public attention in the late 1980s.[407]Due to media coverage in the early 1990s, people often confused climate change with other environmental issues like ozone depletion.[408]In popular culture, theclimate fictionmovieThe Day After Tomorrow(2004) and theAl GoredocumentaryAn Inconvenient Truth(2006) focused on climate change.[407]Significant regional, gender, age and political differences exist in both public concern for, and understanding of, climate change. More highly educated people, and in some countries, women and younger people, were more likely to see climate change as a serious threat.[409]College biology textbooks from the 2010s featured less content on climate change compared to those from the preceding decade, with decreasing emphasis on solutions.[410]Partisan gaps also exist in many countries,[411]and countries with highCO2emissionstend to be less concerned.[412]Views on causes of climate change vary widely between countries.[413]Concern has increased over time,[414]and a majority of citizens in many countries now express a high level of worry about climate change, or view it as a global emergency.[415]Higher levels of worry are associated with stronger public support for policies that address climate change.[416]Climate movementMain articles:Climate movementandClimate change litigationClimate protests demand that political leaders take action to prevent climate change. They can take the form of public demonstrations,fossil fuel divestment, lawsuits and other activities.[417]Prominent demonstrations include theSchool Strike for Climate. In this initiative, young people across the globe have been protesting since 2018 by skipping school on Fridays, inspired by Swedish activist and then-teenagerGreta Thunberg.[418]Masscivil disobedienceactions by groups likeExtinction Rebellionhave protested by disrupting roads and public transport.[419]Litigationis increasingly used as a tool to strengthen climate action from public institutions and companies. Activists also initiate lawsuits which target governments and demand that they take ambitious action or enforce existing laws on climate change.[420]Lawsuits against fossil-fuel companies generally seek compensation forloss and damage.[421]HistoryFor broader coverage of this topic, seeHistory of climate change science.Early discoveriesThis 1912 article succinctly describes the greenhouse effect, how burning coal creates carbon dioxide to cause global warming and climate change.[422]Scientists in the 19th century such asAlexander von Humboldtbegan to foresee the effects of climate change.[423][424][425][426]In the 1820s,Joseph Fourierproposed the greenhouse effect to explain why Earth\\'s temperature was higher than the Sun\\'s energy alone could explain. Earth\\'s atmosphere is transparent to sunlight, so sunlight reaches the surface where it is converted to heat. However, the atmosphere is not transparent to heat radiating from the surface, and captures some of that heat, which in turn warms the planet.[427]In 1856Eunice Newton Footedemonstrated that the warming effect of the Sun is greater for air with water vapour than for dry air, and that the effect is even greater with carbon dioxide (CO2). She concluded that \"An atmosphere of that gas would give to our earth a high temperature...\"[428][429]Studying what would become known as the greenhouse effect, Tyndall\\'s pre-1861ratio spectrophotometermeasured how much various gases in a tube absorb and emit infrared radiation—which humans experience as heat.Starting in 1859,[430]John Tyndallestablished that nitrogen and oxygen—together totalling 99% of dry air—are transparent to radiated heat. However, water vapour and gases such as methane and carbon dioxide absorb radiated heat and re-radiate that heat into the atmosphere. Tyndall proposed that changes in the concentrations of these gases may have caused climatic changes in the past, includingice ages.[431]Svante Arrheniusnoted that water vapour in air continuously varied, but the CO2concentration in air was influenced by long-term geological processes. Warming from increased CO2levels would increase the amount of water vapour, amplifying warming in a positive feedback loop. In 1896, he published the firstclimate modelof its kind, projecting that halving CO2levels could have produced a drop in temperature initiating an ice age. Arrhenius calculated the temperature increase expected from doubling CO2to be around 5–6\\xa0°C.[432]Other scientists were initially sceptical and believed that the greenhouse effect was saturated so that adding more CO2would make no difference, and that the climate would be self-regulating.[433]Beginning in 1938,Guy Stewart Callendarpublished evidence that climate was warming and CO2levels were rising,[434]but his calculations met the same objections.[433]Development of a scientific consensusSee also:Scientific consensus on climate changeScientific consensus on causation:Academic studies of scientific agreement on human-caused global warming among climate experts (2010–2015) reflect that the level of consensus correlates with expertise in climate science.[435]A 2019 study found scientific consensus to be at 100%,[436]and a 2021 study concluded that consensus exceeded 99%.[437]Another 2021 study found that 98.7% of climate experts indicated that the Earth is getting warmer mostly because of human activity.[438]In the 1950s,Gilbert Plasscreated a detailed computer model that included different atmospheric layers and the infrared spectrum. This model predicted that increasing CO2levels would cause warming. Around the same time,Hans Suessfound evidence that CO2levels had been rising, andRoger Revelleshowed that the oceans would not absorb the increase. The two scientists subsequently helpedCharles Keelingto begin a record of continued increase, which has been termed the \"Keeling Curve\".[433]Scientists alerted the public,[439]and the dangers were highlighted at James Hansen\\'s 1988 Congressional testimony.[34]TheIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change(IPCC), set up in 1988 to provide formal advice to the world\\'s governments, spurredinterdisciplinary research.[440]As part of theIPCC reports, scientists assess the scientific discussion that takes place inpeer-reviewedjournalarticles.[441]There is a near-complete scientific consensus that the climate is warming and that this is caused by human activities. As of 2019, agreement in recent literature reached over 99%.[436][437]No scientific body of national or international standingdisagrees with this view.[442]Consensus has further developed that some form of action should be taken to protect people against the impacts of climate change. National science academies have called on world leaders to cut global emissions.[443]The 2021 IPCC Assessment Report stated that it is \"unequivocal\" that climate change is caused by humans.[437]See alsoClimate change portalAnthropocene– proposed geological time interval in which humans are having significant geological impactList of climate scientistsCharney ReportReferences^\"GISS Surface Temperature Analysis (v4)\".NASA.
